# Hear Ye, hear ye! This is the official Hear Ye account!

The main purpose of this account is to make sure no one impersonates
the Hear Ye account, organization, community, or members of Hear
Ye. Content you'll see on this account are primarily in the
Hear Ye organization.

This account serves as an archival platform. Any blog posts that
members of the Hear Ye organization write can be done mostly
anonymously through this account (IP logging and other information
is still tracked whoever uses this account).

Additionally, developers in the Hear Ye organization will be 
conducting some experiments with this account that won't be in the
Hear Ye organization in order to keep some form of intellectual
property. Most intellectual property is published as a form of
transparency using the MariaDB Business License 1.1 or an
open source license like the MIT, BSD-3 Clause, or Apache 2.0
licenses. However, due to the political atmosphere and the
industry this organization breathes in, some pieces of code
and data is kept private. Although we strive to be open, 
there are limitations on openness like how we throttle bots
to avoid vote manipulation or internal discussions between
developers.

Hope this clears things up!
